We have an evening with diverse and advanced topics prepared for you presented by experienced speakers. Registration through Eventbrite is optional, with the benefit that you‚Äôll receive an email notification with the streaming link and a calendar invite.

### How I work from home as a Microsoft Blue Badge

Many of us were finding ourselves in a new situation when we started working from home. Thomas Maurer shares his experience working from home as a Microsoft Cloud Advocate in the Azure team. Thomas has been working remotely for a long time and shares his experience as a remote employee. He talks about how he set up his workspace, manages his tasks, collaborates with his team, and shares a couple of his routines which might also help you.

### Awesome !@#$ with MS Teams

So this whole COVID-thing got you using (and managing) MS Teams, right?

Let‚Äôs look at all the options you have to mange your Teams settings through PowerShell. We‚Äôll run by the different modules for the different parts of MS Teams and share some of the best practices from the field.
